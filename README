Capture, View, Oscilloscope, Plethysmograph
===========================================

Capture is a graphical application that is able to manage streams of data.
A stream of data is an abstract concept that involves a data source, one
or more operations, and a data sink. The application can manage list of
this items, and ensures that the components are arranged in the correct
order. Depending on the compilation options you will have, different
kinds of sources, operations and sinks. When the stream has a source
and a sink, you can start it, allowing the data to flow from the source
to the sink, and you can stop it when you don't need to process more data.
Using the correct components, you can send the data to other processes 
in the same machine or in a remote computer, create a binary acquisition file,
or destroy the input data. Data sources are available from dealing with
different data acquisition cards using the free COMEDI data acquisition
subsystem. Alternatively you can use NIDAQmx or NIDAQmxBase software to
interact with the DAQ hardware using the official drivers.

View is a graphical application that is designed to view the binary acquisition
files created with the file sink. The application accepts a parameter, the
number of seconds per page, is able to show all the signals contained in a
binary acquisition file, using pages of n seconds length. You can move in the
acquisition file using the toolbar and the menu and zoom in the plot. 
Finally you can export the contents of the file to a plain text file too.

Oscilloscope is a virtual instrument that is able to receive the data from the
Capture program, when you are using the Plug operation, and display it to the
user in a graphical plot, with a legend, that shows the number of the channels,
the kind of unit, and the color of the signal. You can configure the listen
address and port too.

Plethysmograph is a virtual instrument that is able to receive the data from the
Capture program, when you are using the Plug operation, and compute the number
of BPM of each signal, displaying each value in a Display. Each display contains
a label that can store the name of the patient or any other info that can help
you. Like with the Oscilloscope you can configure the listen address and port.

BUILD
=====
Read the 'INSTALL' file for more detailed directions.

These programs use the standard ./configure ; make.
Remember, run ./configure --help
to see what build options are available.

In order to compile Freeacq you need to have: 
GTK+ >= 2.18
GLIB >= 2.22
CAIRO >= 1.8.8
GtkDatabox >= 0.9.1.1

And you may need to have installed depending on the configure options:
COMEDILIB >= 0.8
NIDAQmx >= 9.6.0 (Microsoft Windows) 
NIDAQmx >= 8.0.2 (GNU/Linux) or NIDAQmxBase >= 3.6.0


The configure script will fail if you don't.  

If you don't have GTK+ 2.0 installed or any other dependence
you should install it using your distribution's package 
management tools.

RUN
===

You should run 'make install' as root to make sure all the components are
installed in the proper location. Once you've done that, you only need to
run facqcapture, facqoscilloscope, facqplethysmograph, or facqviewer.
